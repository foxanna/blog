After a brief introduction, we jump into the heart of the talk: first, a Flutter expert will interview a fresh Flutter enthusiast for a Junior role; then, the roles reverse. Both parts will contain questions that touch on concepts likely to come up in real-life interviews, followed by a brief post-mortem. Additional Flutter interview resources are included.

After watching this talk, you will walk away with:
* An overview of key concepts:

  * for a Senior role interview
* Interview best practices for interviewees and interviewers
* Confidence going into the interview process
