Hey! 👋 I’m [Anna (Domashych) Leushchenko 👩‍💻💙📱🇺🇦](https://medium.com/@foxanna), the speaker at the upcoming [Flutter Vikings](https://fluttervikings.com/) conference, which is going to take place on Aug 31 — Sep 1 in Oslo, Norway, and online. The online stream is free, so if you are interested in growing your Flutter expertise but are hesitant about the price of in-person attendance or are terrified by the possibility of talking to people, here is the link to [grab your free ticket](https://ti.to/flutter-vikings/2022).

Giving a talk, especially at a conference of such a scale as Flutter Vikings, is a big deal. It is the biggest Flutter conference in Europe, with expected online attendance by thousands of people. Despite my broad technical expertise, as I am not a professional speaker, nor do I have any special training in psychology or eloquence, preparing and giving a talk in front of such an audience is a challenging matter. So I thought I’d share what it takes me to prepare a quality technical talk, what my struggles are, and the tricks that I use to make this stressful process a pleasant journey. Hopefully, it is helpful and inspirational.
