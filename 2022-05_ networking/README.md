# Basic and advanced networking in Dart and Flutter â€” the Tide way

Most applications, be it mobile, web, or desktop, depend on some kind of backend. Thus, an API layer is an integral part of application implementation.

This six-part series presents tools and approaches that facilitate API layer implementation in Flutter and Dart applications we use at [**Tide**](https://www.tide.co/):

* [Part 1: data models with freezed and json_serializable. Basic.](https://medium.com/@foxanna/basic-and-advanced-networking-in-dart-and-flutter-the-tide-way-6e7fb26c0d5c)
* [Part 2: data models with freezed and json_serializable. Advanced.](https://medium.com/@foxanna/basic-and-advanced-networking-in-dart-and-flutter-the-tide-way-170fa08b9169)
* [Part 3: HTTP client and request interceptors with dio. Basic.](https://medium.com/@foxanna/basic-and-advanced-networking-in-dart-and-flutter-the-tide-way-d922fb65a01c)
* [Part 4: HTTP client and request interceptors with dio. Advanced.](https://medium.com/@foxanna/basic-and-advanced-networking-in-dart-and-flutter-the-tide-way-62ca1eef2c5c)
* [Part 5: REST API requests with retrofit. Basic.](https://medium.com/@foxanna/basic-and-advanced-networking-in-dart-and-flutter-the-tide-way-cf82c191a85f)
* [Part 6: REST API requests with retrofit. Advanced.](https://medium.com/@foxanna/basic-and-advanced-networking-in-dart-and-flutter-the-tide-way-161a8f7c9ede)

Each of these parts can be applied independently, but together they complement each other and form a full-fledged API layer implementation.
