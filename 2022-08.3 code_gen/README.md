Data models, JSON serialization, API requests, navigation, localization, dependency injection, tests, assets management are all typical tasks to be solved when developing a mature Flutter application. Quite often, it involves creating boilerplate code. It’s not only boring, time-consuming, and error-prone, but it also requires later maintenance. Code generation with build_runner makes it more fun, it allows creating only the essential code and leaving all the routine to the computer.

We’ll create a Flutter mobile application and apply the build_runner code generation technique to as many tasks as the time allows. Hopefully, it’ll be fun.
